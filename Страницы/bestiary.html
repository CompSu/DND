                <p>Multiattack: The harpy makes two attacks: one with its claws, one with its club.
Claws Melee Weapon: +3 to attack, reach: 1 square, one target. Hit: 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage.
Club Melee Weapon: +3 to attack, reach: 1 square, one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.
Enticing Song:
The harpy sings a magical melody. Each humanoid within 60 squares of the harpy that can hear the melody must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must use a bonus action on each of its turns to continue singing, and can end at any time. If the harpy becomes incapacitated, the song ends

The charmed target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is not adjacent to the harpy, it must use a Roll on its turn to move toward the harpy by the shortest route. This move does not provoke an opportunity attack, but if the target's move would require it to enter a dangerous area, such as lava or a pit, the target can repeat the saving throw. The target also repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the save is successful, the effect ends.</p>

Bite: Melee Weapon: +18 to hit, reach: 1 square, one target. Hit: 23 (3d8 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller and is grappled by the kraken, it is swallowed, ending the grapple. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, has total cover from attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and takes 42 (12d6) poison damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns. If the kraken takes 50 damage or more in a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 2 squares of the kraken. If the kraken swallows a creature, it can no longer escape the body using 3 squares of its movement, immediately standing up.
Tentacle: Melee Weapon: +18 attack bonus, reach 6 squares, one target. Hit: 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape difficulty 18). While the grapple lasts, the target is restrained. The kraken has 10 tentacles, each of which can grapple 1 target.
Throw: The kraken can hurl a grappled Large or smaller object or creature up to 12 squares in a random direction, knocking the creature prone. If the thrown target hits a hard surface, it takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 2 squares it travels. If the target is thrown at another creature, the other creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes the same damage and is knocked prone.
Thunderstorm: The kraken magically creates 3 lightning bolts, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 24 squares of it. The target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

Thunderstorm (Requires 2 Actions)The kraken uses Thunderstorm.
Ink Cloud (Requires 3 Actions): While underwater, the kraken creates a 12-square radius cloud of ink. The cloud curves around corners, and the area within the cloud is heavily obscured to anyone but the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 16 (3d10) poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, or it persists until the end of the kraken's next turn.</p>

                <p>Howl (Recharge 5-6): The demilich lets out a bloodcurdling howl. Each creature within 6 squares of the demilich that can hear the howl must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be reduced to 0 hit points. If successful, the creature is frightened until the end of its next turn.
Life Drain: The demilich attacks up to 3 creatures it can see within 2 squares of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 21 (6d6) necrotic damage, and the demilich regains hit points equal to the total damage dealt.
Legendary Actions:
Fly: The demilich flies up to half its flying speed.
Dust Cloud: The demilich magically creates a dust storm from its remains. Each creature within 2 squares of the demilich, including those hiding around corners, must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of the demilich's next turn. If the saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to Cloud until the end of the demilich's next turn.
Drain Energy (Requires 2 Actions): Each creature within 6 squares of the demilich must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by 10 (3d6). If a creature's hit point maximum is reduced to 0, the creature dies. The creature's hit point maximum can be restored with a Greater Restoration spell or similar magic.
Vile Curse (Requires 3 Actions): The demilich attacks one creature it can see within 6 squares of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become magically cursed. While the curse is in effect, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; if it succeeds, the curse ends.</p>

                <p>A spectral humanoid skeleton dressed in tattered black robes and wielding a spectral scythe. It appears within 10 feet of you (in a location of the DM's choosing) and attacks you, warning everyone that you must win this battle alone.
